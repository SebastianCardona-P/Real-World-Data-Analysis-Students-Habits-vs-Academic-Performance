## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze a synthetic dataset of student habits and their impact on academic performance, sourced from Kaggle (`student_habits_performance.csv`). The dataset contains 1,000 student records with features like study hours, sleep patterns, social media usage, diet quality, mental health, and exam scores. The project involves data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and unit testing to ensure robust analysis, targeting at least 90% test coverage. The focus is on identifying patterns, relationships, and distributions to understand how lifestyle habits influence academic outcomes.

## Project Description

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Data Analysis (**`student_analysis.py`**):** A Python script that loads, cleans, and visualizes the student dataset, generating multiple plots to explore distributions, relationships, and categorical breakdowns.
2. **Unit Tests (**`test_student_analysis.py`**):** A suite of tests ensuring the correctness of data processing and visualization functions, achieving &gt;90% code coverage.
3. **Dataset (**`student_habits_performance.csv`**):** A synthetic CSV file with 1,000 student records, reflecting realistic patterns of student habits and academic performance, sourced from Kaggle.

The analysis focuses on identifying trends (e.g., study hours vs. exam scores), distributions (e.g., age, sleep hours), and relationships (e.g., impact of part-time jobs, parental education, internet quality, and extracurricular activities on academic performance and mental health).

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Validation

The `student_analysis.py` script performs the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning:**

  - Removes rows with missing values using `dropna()`.
  - Ensures numerical columns (`age, study_hours_per_day,  , netflix_hours, attendance_percentage, sleep_hours, exercise_frequency, mental_health_rating, exam_score`) are non-negative.
  - Clips numerical values to realistic ranges:
    - Age: 15-30 years.
    - Study, social media, Netflix, and sleep hours: 0-24 hours/day.
    - Attendance percentage and exam score: 0-100%.

- **Data Validation:**

  - Validates that numerical columns do not contain negative values.
  - Ensures categorical columns (`gender`, `part_time_job`, `diet_quality`, `parental_education_level`, `internet_quality`, `extracurricular_participation`) contain expected values.

### Key Relationships

- **Study Hours vs. Exam Score:** Strong positive correlation (0.8229), indicating more study time significantly improves academic performance.
- **Social Media/Netflix Hours vs. Exam Score:** Weak negative correlations (-0.1717 and -0.1666), suggesting excessive screen time slightly lowers scores.
- **Mental Health vs. Exam Score:** Moderate positive correlation (0.3179), showing better mental health is associated with higher scores.
- **Sleep vs. Study Hours:** Very weak correlation (-0.0262), indicating sleep and study time are largely independent.
- **Part-Time Job Impact:** Students with part-time jobs, in theory, tend to have fewer study hours and lower test scores due to time constraints. But this isn't the case, as the two cases are very similar. This means that students who don't work are likely distracted by other things.
- **Parental Education Impact:** A higher level of parental education (e.g., a master's degree) is correlated with better test scores, possibly due to better resources. That's what one would think, but it's quite the opposite: students whose parents have bachelor's degrees performed better, perhaps due to the motivation of providing a professional degree for the family.

### Errors Detected

- **Unrealistic Values:**
  - No negative values found in numerical columns after cleaning.
- **Missing Values:** Removed 91 rows with missing data during cleaning (original dataset had 1,000 rows, cleaned dataset has 909 rows).
- **Duplicates:** No duplicate `student_id` values detected, as expected.

### General Analysis

The dataset provides a realistic snapshot of student habits and academic performance, with 909 students (after cleaning) aged 17-24, a balanced gender distribution, and a variety of lifestyle factors. Key findings:

- **Academic Performance:** Exam scores range from 18.4 to 100 (mean \~69.56), with a strong correlation to study hours (0.8229).
- **Lifestyle Habits:** Students average 3.54 study hours, 2.50 social media hours, 1.83 Netflix hours, and 6.47 sleep hours per day.
- **External Factors:** Neither part-time jobs, poor internet quality, nor a lack of extracurricular participation negatively impacted study time and results, while students with parents who earned bachelor's degrees made much greater efforts to achieve better grades.
- **Data Quality:** The dataset is relatively clean after processing, with no major errors like duplicates or unrealistic values post-cleaning.

### Test Coverage

The `test_student_analysis.py` file achieves &gt;90% coverage for `student_analysis.py`, with tests covering:

- Data loading and cleaning (`load_data`, `clean_data`).
- Statistical functions (`test_normality`, `calculate_correlation`).
- All visualization functions (`plot_pie_chart`, `plot_histogram`, `plot_scatter`, `plot_boxplot`).
- Edge cases (e.g., negative ages, invalid hours).

Coverage report (to be updated after running tests):

```

--------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        176     14    92%

```

### Creating the Visualizations

To generate the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Ensure dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
   ```

2. Run the analysis script:

   ```bash
   python student_analysis.py
   ```

   This processes `student_habits_performance.csv` and generates plots in the `plots` directory.

3. Review the generated PNG files in the `plots` directory.

### Conclusions

This project successfully analyzes a synthetic dataset on student habits, identifying key factors influencing academic performance. The visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the data, highlighting strengths such as the strong correlation between study hours and test scores, and realistic distributions of habits such as sleep and screen time. Weaknesses include the right-skewed nature of some variables (e.g., time spent on social media), although, against all odds, it is interesting to see that a part-time job does not affect test scores, internet quality, mental health, or parental education level. With test coverage above 90%, the analysis is reliable, and the quality of the dataset allows for valuable insights. The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and testing, making it a valuable tool for understanding the interplay between student habits and academic success.
